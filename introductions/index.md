# Introduction

## Background
Accroding to the type of variable, optimization problem can be categorized into two groups: stochastic optimization and deterministic optimization.


## Feature
One important feature is to provide web-based interactive interface, which is similar to [codepen](https://codepen.io/), so that make the learning faster.
